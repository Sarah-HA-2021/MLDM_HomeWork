# Genetic Approach for Optimizing Ensembles of Classifiers

## Warm up 
### Ensemble Learning 
As we have seen during our course, ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal predictive model.

## Problem  this paper is solving 
It is common in the research on this topic to select by hand :
* the right combination of classifiers 
* the method to combine them 
or exhaustive search is used when (the number of classifiers and algorithms to use is small)

## Method this paper is proposing
genetic algorithms for selecting the classifiers and the combination methods

# Steps 
## First we generated & tested the classifiers on one dataset to compare paper's results with ours , the code for that can be found above 
For this task we picked glass dataset and here are the results 

| Method | Our results| Paper's results|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IBK` | 70.56 % |69.13 % |
| `K*` | 75.70 % | 75.67 % |
| `DT` | 70.09 % | 70.47 % |
| `NaiveBayes` | 49.53 % | 49.54 % |
| `C4.5` | 65.89 % | 61.23 % |
| `StC(3)` | 63.08 % | 68.70 % |
| `Boosting` | 79.44 % | 73.33 % |
| `Bagging` | 75.23 % | 71.51 % |

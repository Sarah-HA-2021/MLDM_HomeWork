## Definition 
A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theory of natural evolution.

## Genetic Algorithm Phases 
Five phases are considered in a genetic algorithm.

1. Initial population
2. Fitness function
3. Selection
4. Crossover
5. Mutation

The report contains more detials about each one of the phases.
